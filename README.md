Notebooks and scripts that analyze infrared data from the VIIRS satellite instrument and train a neural network to quantify the dust in the atmosphere.  

## VIIRS Satelite and Infrared Bands 
[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/sensors/viirs) has 22 spectral bands, ranging from visible to longwave IR. There are 16 moderate resolution bands, 5 imagining bands, and 1 day-night band. The thermal infrared (IR) bands on radiometers such as the VIIRS instruments are sensitive to coarse elevated aerosols like mineral dust, but not other smaller-sized aerosols.
